### Connectivity

The main connectivity APIs in Arm Mbed OS are:

* [Network sockets](network_sockets.md): provide a common interface for using sockets on network devices.
* [Ethernet](ethernet.md): API for connecting to the internet over an Ethernet connection.
* [Wi-Fi](wifi.md): API for connecting to the internet with a Wi-Fi device.
* [Mesh networking](mesh.md): Mbed OS provides two kinds of IPv6-based mesh networks - 6LoWPAN_ND and Thread.
* [Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)](ble.md): designed for small, energy-efficient BLE applications.
* [Cellular](cellular.md): API for connecting to the internet using a cellular device.


#### Arm Mbed Mesh

Mbed Mesh API allows the application to use the IPv6 mesh network topologies through the [nanostack](docs/tutorials/mesh/02_N_arch.md) netowrking stack.

Mbed OS provides two types of IPv6 based mesh networks:

* 6LoWPAN_ND, loosely following the Zigbee-IP specification.
* Thread, following the specification from Thread Group.

Nanostack is the networking stack which provides both of these protocols. For more information on the stack internals, refer to [Nanostack documentation](docs/tutorials/mesh/02_N_arch.md). Application developers use Nanostack through Mbed Mesh API.

The application can use the `LoWPANNDInterface` or `ThreadInterface` object for connecting to the mesh network and when successfully connected, the application can use the [Mbed C++ socket API](network_sockets.md) to create a socket to start communication with a remote peer.

The `NanostackEthernetInterface` is provided for Ethernet.

##### Supported mesh networking modes

Currently, 6LoWPAN-ND (neighbour discovery) and Thread bootstrap modes are supported.

##### Module Configuration

This module supports static configuration via the **Mbed configuration system**. The application needs to create an `mbed_app.json` configuration file if you want to use other than default settings.

An example of the configuration file:

```
{
    "target_overrides": {
        "*": {
            "target.features_add": ["IPV6"],
            "mbed-mesh-api.6lowpan-nd-channel": 12,
            "mbed-mesh-api.6lowpan-nd-channel-mask": "(1<<12)",
            "mbed-mesh-api.heap-size": 10000
        }
    }
}
```

###### Network connection states

After the initialization, the network state is `MESH_DISCONNECTED`. After a successful connection, the state changes to `MESH_CONNECTED` and when disconnected from the network the state is changed back to `MESH_DISCONNECTED`.

In case of connection errors, the state is changed to some of the connection error states. In an error state, there is no need to make a `disconnect` request and the application is allowed to attempt connecting again.

#### Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is a low power wireless technology standard for personal area networks. Typical applications of BLE are health care, fitness trackers, beacons, smart home, security, entertainment, proximity sensors, industrial and automotive.

Arm Mbed BLE, also called `BLE_API`, is the Bluetooth Low Energy software solution for Mbed. Many targets support Mbed BLE. Developers can use it to create new BLE applications.

##### Getting started

1. Choose an [Arm Mbed board that supports BLE](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/?mbed-enabled=15&connectivity=3), such as the [NRF51-DK](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/Nordic-nRF51-DK/).

	If your platform doesn't support BLE but is compatible with the Arduino UNO R3 connector, you can use an extension board such as the [X-NUCLEO-IDB05A1](https://developer.mbed.org/components/X-NUCLEO-IDB05A1-Bluetooth-Low-Energy/) to add BLE capabilities to your development board.

1. Install a BLE scanner on your phone. It allows you to track all BLE activities from your embedded application. This is a mandatory tool for BLE software development:

    * [nRF Master Control Panel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp) for Android.

    * [LightBlue](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/lightblue-bluetooth-low-energy/id557428110?mt=8) for iPhone.

1. Compile and run our BLE samples:

    * **Arm Mbed OS 5 samples** are available on [developer.mbed.org](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/mbed-os-examples/) and [Github](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-example-ble):
        * The [beacon](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/mbed-os-examples/code/mbed-os-example-ble-Beacon/) example is a good starting point; it demonstrates how you can create a BLE beacon with just a few lines of code.  
        * The [heart rate monitor](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/mbed-os-examples/code/mbed-os-example-ble-HeartRate/) example demonstrates how to build a heart rate sensor that can be connected and monitored by a BLE client such as your phone.
        * The [LED](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/mbed-os-examples/code/mbed-os-example-ble-LED/) and [LED blinker](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/mbed-os-examples/code/mbed-os-example-ble-LEDBlinker/) are a single example, which demonstrates how a client (LED) and a server (LED blinker) work together over BLE.

    <span>**Tip:** Despite the differences between the different Mbed OS versions, there is only **one** version of Mbed BLE, and it is easy to move code from one version of the OS to another. Choose the sample you use according to the version of Mbed OS supported by your development board.</span>

##### Going further

* [Introduction to Mbed BLE](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/ble-intros/en/latest/) is a resource for developers new to BLE and Mbed BLE. It covers how to build BLE embedded applications with Mbed.

* The Bluetooth Low Energy main [page](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/Bluetooth-Low-Energy/) on developer.mbed.org also provide samples and resources around BLE.

* The Mbed BLE [API reference](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/ble-api/en/master/api/index.html) offer the full details of the API.

* The Mbed BLE [online community](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/Bluetooth-Low-Energy/community/) is also a great place to ask questions and share your knowledge.
